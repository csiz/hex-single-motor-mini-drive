Motor model parameters
----------------------

[ ] rotor inertial mass
[ ] phase inductance L
[ ] phase resistance R
[ ] motor Kv constant
[ ] hysterisis angle alpha

	Apparently the phase delay between the motor flux and stator flux is constant and
	depends on the hysterisis loop characteristic of the rotor construction.
[ ] hysterisis friction torque
	The hysterisis torque is also constant
[ ] static friction torque (fixed torque at standstill)
[ ] dynamic friction torque (fixed torque when rotating)
[ ] resistance friction torque (this one is proportional to rotation speed)
[ ] battery internal resistance
[ ] mosfet resistance
[ ] mosfet reverse diode voltage drop
[ ] hall sensor toggle flux


During the energised phase the motor
