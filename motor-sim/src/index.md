3 Phase Motor Driver
====================


The Hex Mini Drive is intended to be a low cost FOC servo driver for 3 phase brushless motors (BLDC) 
commonly found in drones. Using the back EMF from the motor the driver can turn any brushless motor
into a servo with fine torque control and position feedback. Designed for robotic applications.
